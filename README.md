# FederalBudget
R Repository for working with key budget docs. All data is first cleaned and tidied from original online sources using R code saved in the "Script" folder, then exported as a completed .csv file to the "Data" folder. As a matter of principle, Hadley Wickham's packages are employed whenever possible. 

## Summary of Included Docs
1. 2016 White House Federal Budget (FY16 PBR)
2. OMB Historical Tables

## Description of Included Docs
[2016 White House Federal Budget:](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data) The White House has posted three .csv files that can be used to reproduce many of the tables in the administration's budget books. The three files are:
* budget authorizations
* outlays
* receipts

OMB's [user guide](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data/blob/master/USER_GUIDE.md) includes necessary data definitions and many helpful references to supplemental budget materials.
